# Bengali-calendar-gnome-shell-extension
An extension for gnome-shell that adds a Bengali calendar to the top panel, which displays the current date in Bangla. At the moment this extension is displaying the revised Bengali calendar dates, which is used as the official calendar in People's Republic of Bangladesh. Bengali calendar used in West Bengal has been added, however there is no easy way to switch between the two dates at the moment. 

Changing the variable ```mode``` in ```extension.js``` to equal to ```WB_MODE``` is the current workaround. I will need to look more into gjs to progress further with this project.
